# OLAF Chat System

## Overview

The OLAF Chat System is a secure, distributed chat application built using the OLAF protocol. It is designed to ensure secure communication between clients and servers in a decentralized network. This project is part of an Advanced Secure Programming assignment where security and protocol implementation are the main focus.

## Features

- **Client-Server Communication**: Secure messaging between clients and servers.
- **Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using AES with secure key exchange mechanisms.
- **Authentication**: Servers authenticate clients before allowing them to join the network.
- **Distributed Topology**: Supports a decentralized network of interconnected servers.
- **Robustness**: Designed to handle malicious actors and ensure message integrity.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required dependencies.
